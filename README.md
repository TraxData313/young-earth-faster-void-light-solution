# 🌌 Fast-Light in Voids: A Young Universe Perspective

### 📝 Summary
There are no limitations for light to travel faster in the void of space, without needing billions of years to reach us from distant galaxies.

In fact, light speed through different materials on Earth hints that its speed should shoot up to infinity as energy density approaches 0 in the voids of space.

Explains why we don't see older galaxies the farther we look and removes the need for huge amounts of theorized—but never observed—“dark matter” to have kept very fast-spinning galaxies stable for billions of years.

### ⚡ Direct Light Speed Observations

Light speed `c` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(Energy Density)`. As the `Energy Density` approaches zero in the deep voids of space, the speed of light `c` approaches infinity (`Energy Density → 0` ⇒ `c → ∞`), so light should traverse the voids of deep space almost instantly—no billions of years needed.

## 🔬 Physics Basis

From electromagnetism:

`c = 1 / sqrt(μ * ε)`

Where:  
- `μ` = vacuum permeability  
- `ε` = vacuum permittivity  
- Let `R = μ * ε` (**vacuum impedance term**)

Then:

`c = 1 / sqrt(R)`
- If `R` falls in low-energy-density voids, `c` rises sharply.  
- No “new physics” is invented — we reinterpret known constants as environmental variables.

## 📌 Key Supporting Points

- **Galaxies look mature at all distances**  
  - JWST and Hubble have found large, stable, mature galaxies very far away (at high redshift `z > 6`), when the standard model says they should look primitive.
  - In this model, short look-back times explain the lack of “younger” galaxies.

- **Dark matter problem reduced or eliminated**  
  - In ΛCDM, high rotation speeds over billions of years require massive unseen halos of “dark matter” to keep the galaxies stable.
  - In this model, galaxy stability is considered over thousands of years—making the need for huge invisible halos vanish or shrink.

## ✅ Summary
- The direct Bible interpretation that the universe was created about **6,000 years** ago is consistent with what we observe.
- We follow the pattern of light speed increasing very fast as the medium gets more void-like, allowing light to reach us without needing years to do so.
- We don't have to invent huge amounts of **dark energy** to explain expansion and light **redshifting**.
- We don't have to invent huge amounts of **dark matter** to keep the galaxies stable over supposed billions of years.
- We don't see an increasing number of “proto”/old galaxies as we look farther—we see them roughly the same as expected.

## ✝️ For Bible Believers

- The observable physics doesn't “prove the Bible wrong”; on the contrary, it supports it.
- Provides a physics-based mechanism consistent with a **literal 6-day creation** and a **~6,000-year** Earth age.
- Explains how distant starlight could be—and is expected to be—visible on Day 4 even with the current physical laws.
