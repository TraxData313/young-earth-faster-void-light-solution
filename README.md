# üåå Fast-Light in Voids: A Young Universe Perspective


## Summary
There are no limitation for light not to travel faster in the void of space without needed billions of years to reach us from the distant Galaxies. 

In fact light speed through different materials on Earth hints that its speed should shoot up to infinity as energy dencity approaches 0 in the voids of space.

Explains why we don't see older Galaxies the further we look and removes the need for huge amounts of theorized but never observed "dark matter" to have kept the very fast spinning Galaxies stable for billions of years.

## Direct Light Speed Observations

Light speed `c` is proportional to `1 / sqrt(Energy Density)`, as the `Energy Density` approaches zero in the deep voids of space, the speed of light `c` approaches infinity, or `Energy Density ‚Üí 0` => `c ‚Üí ‚àû`, so the light should traverse the voids of deep space almost instantly - no billions of years needed.

## üî¨ Physics Basis

From electromagnetism:

`c = 1 / sqrt(Œº * Œµ)`

Where:  
- `Œº` = vacuum permeability  
- `Œµ` = vacuum permittivity  
- Let `R = Œº * Œµ` (**vacuum impedance term**)

Then:

`c = 1 / sqrt(R)`
- If `R` falls in low-energy-density voids, `c` rises sharply.  
- No ‚Äúnew physics‚Äù is invented ‚Äî we reinterpret known constants as environmental variables.

## Key Supporting Points

- **Galaxies look mature at all distances**  
  - JWST and Hubble have found large, stable, mature galaxies very far away (at high redshift `z > 6`), when the standard model says they should look primitive.
  - In this model, short look-back times explain the lack of ‚Äúyounger‚Äù galaxies.

- **Dark matter problem reduced or eliminated**  
  - In ŒõCDM, high rotation speeds over billions of years require massive unseen halos of "dark matter" to keep the Galaxies stable.
  - In this model, galaxy stability is considered over thousands of years ‚Äî making the need for huge invisible halos vanish or shrink.

## ‚úÖ Summary
- The direct Bible interpretation that the Universe is created about 6 000 years ago is consistent with what we observe
- We follow the pattern of light speed increasing very fast as the medium gets voider, allowing the light to reach us without needing years to do so
- We don't have to invent huge amounts of "dark enery" to explain expansion and light red shifting
- We don't have to invent huge amounts of "dakr matter" to keep the Galaxies stable at the supposed billions of years
- We don't see increasing number of "proto"/old Galaxies as we look further - we see them the same as expected

## ‚úùÔ∏è For Bible Believers

- The observable physics doesn't "prove the Bible wrong", on the contrary, it supports it.
- Provides a physics-based mechanism consistent with a **literal 6-day creation** and a **~6,000-year** Earth age.
- Explains how distant starlight could be and is expected to be visible on Day 4 even with the current physical laws.
